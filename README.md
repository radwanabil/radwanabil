ðŸŒ± I am a recent graduate from the Computer and Communication Department at Alexandria University. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge by studying at ITI Open Source Track, where I am learning about new technologies and their applications.<br>

âš¡ Besides my passion for technology, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills outside of the tech world. In my free time, I like to read, draw, and even indulge in some gardening. I am also an avid swimmer and enjoy staying active.<br>
